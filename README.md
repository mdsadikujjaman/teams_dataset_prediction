- Linear Regression and XGBoost were applied to predict key target variables.
- XGBoost showed stronger performance with higher R² scores.
- Strong correlations were identified between goals, wins, and points.


## 📎 Visualizations
- Heatmaps for feature correlation
- Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted values
- Distribution plots of key statistics


## 🧠 Learnings & Insights
- Preprocessing plays a crucial role in improving model performance.
- XGBoost outperformed traditional regression on non-linear relationships.
- Feature engineering can be further explored to improve prediction.

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Implement cross-validation techniques
- Add hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Try additional models like Random Forest, Lasso, or Ridge
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
